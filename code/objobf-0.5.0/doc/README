burneye2 objobf - x86/Linux ELF relocateable object obfuscator
=============================================================================

This program obfuscates .o ELF objects and can create graphs visualizing
the structure of a function.


Building
--------

cd src && make


Quick info
----------

It should be able to handle fairly large object files by now, as all compiler
generated constructs are supported. If in trouble, try with/without
optimization options.

Read the manpage ("man -l objobf.1") for examples. The graph output stuff may
be interesting (visually at least :)

Also try to load the output objects produced in IDA.

See doc/FAQ for some points not in the manpage.


Graphs
------

For graphs produced with loop detection, you need the aiSee visualization
tool, which is available from http://www.aisee.com/download/
(Symlink it to "xvcg" to have objobf call it correctly and display the graph
with gv).
