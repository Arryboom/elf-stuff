FAQ for objobf
--------------


Q: Why is objobf under the LGPL, while it is no library?

A: To prevent anyone making modifications to it and using them commercially. In
   case someone wants to do that, he would have to modify objobf to use a
   library interface and publish all changes made to the library/objobf itself.
   This way you can use it in a commercial tool but still the changes on the
   objobf part are made available to the public.



Q: I found a bug, what to do?

A: Please send the objobf binary, the ELF object file and exact information how
   to reproduce the bug. (Also describe exactly what you think the bug is).
   Send the information to teso@team-teso.net and scut@team-teso.net.
