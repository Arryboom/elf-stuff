FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION

  We need to instruct the linker to allocate space in a section for the common
symbols. That is, symbols either having STT_COMMON as type or SHN_COMMON as
section header index, or both. This are usually C external variables. To do
this, use the GNU ld option "-d" or - when using a linker script - the option
command "FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION". See the examples/ directory.
