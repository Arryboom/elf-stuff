*** This is program does not guarantee any functionality and may break your

*** stuff from malicious people. Also, please be aware that in the
*** non-passworded or non-fingerprinted mode (you can combine both for extra
*** security) any serious reverse engineer is able to unwrap the binary in
*** minutes. In the passworded binary however, it is hardly possible if the
*** password is not known. Rule of thumb: if the binary runs, it can be broken.
*** The binding is still very weak between the encryption engine and the
*** binary, so unwrapping is possible.
